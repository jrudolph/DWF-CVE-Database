In the globbing function that parses the numerical range, there was an omission that made curl read a byte beyond the end of the URL if given a carefully crafted, or just wrongly written, URL. The URL is stored in a heap based buffer, so it could then be made to wrongly read something else instead of crashing. An example of a URL that triggers the flaw would be `http://ur%20[0-60000000000000000000`."}]},"data_type": "CVE","affects": {"vendor": {"vendor_data": [{"product": {"product_data": [{"version": {"version_data": [{"version_value": "curl 7.34.0 to and including 7.54.1"}]},"product_name": "curl"}]},"vendor_name": "curl"}]}},"CVE_data_meta": {"DATE_ASSIGNED": "2017-08-22T17:29:33.316423","ID": "CVE-2017-1000101","ASSIGNER": "kurt@seifried.org","REQUESTER": "daniel@haxx.se"},"data_format": "MITRE","problemtype": {"problemtype_data": [{"description": [{"lang": "eng","value": "buffer overread"}]}]}}
